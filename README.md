## Part II: Inscriptions

### Darwaza-e-Rauza

> IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE MOST GRACIOUS, THE DISPENSER OF GRACE:<br>
> \(1\) CONSIDER the daybreak<br>
> \(2\) and the ten nights!<br>
> \(3\) Consider the multiple and the One!<br>
> \(4\) Consider the night as it runs its course!<br>
> \(5\) Considering all this – could there be, to anyone endowed with
> reason, a \[more\] solemn evidence of the truth?<br>
> \(6\) ART THOU NOT aware of how thy Sustainer has dealt with \[the
> tribe of\] \`Ād,<br>
> \(7\) \[the people of\] Iram the many-pillared,<br>
> \(8\) the like of whom has never been reared in all the land? –<br>
> \(9\) and with \[the tribe of\] Thamūd, who hollowed out rocks in the
> valley? –<br>
> \(10\) and with Pharaoh of the \[many\] tent-poles?<br>
> \(11\) \[It was they\] who transgressed all bounds of equity all over
> their lands,<br>
> \(12\) and brought about great corruption therein:<br>
> \(13\) and therefore thy Sustainer let loose upon them a scourge of
> suffering:<br>
> \(14\) for, verily, thy Sustainer is ever on the watch!<br>
> \(15\) BUT AS FOR man, whenever his Sustainer tries him by His
> generosity and by letting him enjoy a life of ease, he says, “My
> Sustainer has been \[justly\] generous towards me”;<br>
> \(16\) whereas, whenever He tries him by straitening his means of
> livelihood, he says, “My Sustainer has disgraced me!”<br>
> \(17\) But nay, nay, \[O men, consider all that you do and fail to
> do:\] you are not generous towards the orphan,<br>
> \(18\) and you do not urge one another to feed the needy,<br>
> \(19\) and you devour the inheritance \[of others\] with devouring
> greed,<br>
> \(20\) and you love wealth with boundless love!<br>
> \(21\) Nay, but \[how will you fare on Judgment Day,\] when the earth
> is crushed with crushing upon crushing,<br>
> \(22\) and \[the majesty of\] thy Sustainer stands revealed, as well
> as \[the true nature of\] the angels, rank upon rank?<br>
> \(23\) And on that Day hell will be brought \[within sight\]; on that
> Day man will remember \[all that he did and failed to do\]: but what
> will that remembrance avail him?<br>
> \(24\) He will say, “Oh, would that I had provided beforehand for my
> life \[to come\]!”<br>
> \(25\) For none can make suffer as He will make suffer \[the sinners\]
> on that Day,<br>
> \(26\) and none can bind with bonds like His.<br>
> \(27\) \[But unto the righteous God will say,\] “O thou human being
> that hast attained to inner peace!<br>
> \(28\) Return thou unto thy Sustainer, well-pleased \[and\] pleasing
> \[Him\]:<br>
> \(29\) enter, then, together with My \[other true\] servants –<br>
> \(30\) yea, enter thou My paradise!”(*Message of the Qurʼan* 89.1-30)[^10]

> completed about this time, and whose detailed description will
> presently be given. And those men of piety who were in attendance,
> comprising learned scholars, saintly persons, those who had committed
> the Quran to memory (huffaz), and the needy and deserving, devoted
> themselves to reciting the Our'an and the Fatiha. And having graced
> that bountiful place with his presence, the Monarch of ocean-like
> liberality distributed at this function half of the fixed sum of
> 50,000 rupees, and the next morning, he returned again, and
> distributed the remaining half among the assembled women (Begley, *Taj
> Mahal* 65).[^12]

### Padshah Nama of Kalim

> \(1\) Upon her grave—may it be illumined till the Resurrection!—The
> King of Kings constructed such an edifice,<br>
> \(2\) That since the Divine Decree drew creation’s plan, Non one has
> seen its equal in magnificence.<br>
> (3)An edifice, whose quality imparts such stability And firmness to
> the mansion of description,<br>
> (4)That, even if they became submerged in water, Its couplets (bait)
> \[also meaans house\] would escape ruin.<br>
> (5)Since heaven’s vault has been standing, an edifce like this Has
> never risen to compete against the sky (Begley, *Taj Mahal* 82).[^13]

### Zafar Nama-i-Shah Jahan of Qudsi

> \(1\) How excellent is the holy tomb of the Bilqis of the Age, Which
> became the couch of that Lady of the Universe.<br>
> \(2\) An illumined place like the garden of Paradise; As fragrant as
> Paradise mixed with ambergris.<br>
> \(3\) The Houris, adored with scented beauty marks \[?\], Continually
> sweep its courtyard with the brooms of their eyelashes.<br>
> \(4\) Its walls are studded with precious gems, Lending the air
> exhirlatering freshness from their watery luster.<br>
> \(5\) The builder of this sacred threshold, Has brought its water
> \[luster\] from the fountainhead of divine beauty (Begley, *Taj Mahal* 85).[^14]
